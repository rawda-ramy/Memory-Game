* To start the game, first you must choose the style or shape that you prefer for the game body

*Then the game allows you 3 seconds to take a look at the places of the cards, and you have to start playing while remembering the places of the similar cards depending on your memory.
*On the right of the page, two counters are renewed. The wrong times and the correct times are calculated for you from your card choices,
*After you finish, if the number of your mistakes is equal to 0 or 1, you get the sentence "Well Done” in addition to three stars,If the number of your mistakes is tow or three,

## Files-Description:

* In the main "project.html" file the structure and contents of the game are created.

* In the "project.css" file for the shape and aesthetics of the game, it contains commands written in "css" that control the shape and arrangement of the game.

* In the "Images" file are the images used to build the structure of the game.

* The "Audio" file ؤontains the audio and sound effects used in the game.

* The game contains several styles for its shape and arrangement,and these styles are represented in
* four sub-files "style-01.css" which is resposable for the "Fruit" style ,  "style-02.css" which is resposable for the "Winter" style
*"style-03.css" which is resposable for the "Desert" style and "style-04.css" which is resposable for the "Ancient Landmarks" evry stylesheet with a different style and different commands in css.

* The tag "script" is the responsible tag for the game's interaction with the user and contains commands in the "Java Script" language that make the page dynamic,
and it is the most important and complex file on which the game depends.



## Challenges

* I learned a lot while building the project and for sure I'm going to learn a lot more while maintaining it.
* That's why I want to keep track of the challenges that I've had along the way so that I can reference them in the future.

### HTML page

* I tried hard to keep the main page clear and simple as possable and i kind of liked to manage the game using scripts and style sheets it's more better and organized.

### CSS File

* I realy was carefull and Keen to Ensure the consistency of colors, images and backgrounds together, It was important for me that the game be organized and
* beautiful in terms of aesthetics and consistency,so I tried not to make it exaggerated or contain dissonant formats,
* which led to me making many modifications and creating many copies to reach the result the best.

### Script
* I wanted to make the game work dynamically and not in a static way, so you find that most of the game commands were written using “script”
* and many problems were encountered that required searching for hours to find a solution for them or to implement a specific idea and adjust it to the form and work mechanism required
* to present the project with a low probability of occurrence Error.


### Errors
* My way was hindered a lot because of the “” that appears suddenly and interferes with the work of the game, especially in the language of “python” and the use of “flask” as the errors
* appeared a lot, and sometimes I had to search for its meaning and solve it for days, but at the end of the project I forgive it. It is very easy to understand and solve,
* and This is one of the most valuable things I learned while working on the project
